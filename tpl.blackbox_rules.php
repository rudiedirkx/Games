<p>You must find all Atoms! The Atoms are hidden in the grey field.<br/>
You can fire beams that might tell you the location of the Atoms.<br/>
You do that by clicking on side cells (the lighter grey ones).<br/>
A beam turns before it hits an Atom.<br/>If you fire a beam from below and there is an Atom on the left somewhere,the beam will turn to the right:<br/>

<b>When the beam reaches another side cell, both cells are colored!</b><br/>
If it directly hits an atom its absorbed:<br/>
<img src="/141.php?image=bb1"><br/>
<b>The side cell (where the beam came from) is then GREY!</b><br/>
It's also possible that a beam makes a U-turn and gets right back where it came from.<br/>
Either it doesnt get the chance to enter the field (there's an atom right or left of where the beam enters)<br/>
or it must make a U-turn:<br/>

<b>The side cell is then WHITE!</b><br/>
